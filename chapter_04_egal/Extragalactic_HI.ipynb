We begin with an overview of the observed HI morphologies (chapter 4.1) and kinematics (chapter 4.2) of equilibrium disks. We then focus on the relationship between the properties of these resolved disks and star formation therein in chapter 4.3, and how the distortions observed in interacting galaxies are a sensitive tracer of environmental effects. We conclude this chapter with an overview of HI absorption as a tracer of galaxy structure."

    "The dissipative nature of gas and the conservation of angular momentum imposed by gravity imply that gas in undisturbed galaxies is typically distributed in a thin disk whose radial extent well exceeds its vertical one. Examples of the HI surface density distribution in a face-on HI disk is shown in Fig. 4.1 and from an edge-on disk is shown in Fig. 4.2; they illustrate the basic properties of HI disks for Milky Way-like systems. By virtue of the optically thin nature of HI in most parts of a galaxy (ref here), HI maps of galaxies are typically given in units of column density, $N_{HI}$: atoms $cm^{-2}$, or $Mo pc^{-2}$; they are obtained by integrating the HI emission measured along each line-of-sight in the map (see Chapter 9.XXX), and as such are sometimes called *Moment 0* or *total intensity* maps.

The outer HI surface densities ($N_{HI} = 2 M_o pc^{-2}$) of galaxies follow exponential distributions whose radial scale lengths are 50&#37; larger than those of the optical disk (Bigiel &amp; Blitz 2012; Wang et al. 2014; more here). For example, the and exponential fit to the ensemble of outer HI disk profiles in the sample of Bigiel &amp; Blitz (2012) has a radial scale length of $r_{D,HI} = 0.61r_{25}$, where $r_{25}$ is the radius of the optical disk measured at a (*B*-band) isophotal level of 25 magnitudes per square arcsec."

    "As was first noticed in the late 90s (Broeils &amp; Rhee 1997), there is a tight correlation between the radial extent of HI disks of galaxies and their total HI masses. The relation was confirmed in several studies and recently revisited with a large dataset of Wang et al. (2016; see also Wang et al. 2014, and others here). The relationship between the HI diameter $D_{HI}$ and mass $M_{HI}$ obtained by Wang et al. (2016) is shown in Fig. 4.2, and the best-fitting linear relationship describing the trend is given by: $$log(D_{HI}) = (0.506 +/- 0.003) log(M_{HI}) - (3.293 +/- 0.009),$$ where $D_{HI}$ is measured in kpc at $N_{HI}=1 M_{o} pc^{-2}$, and $M_{HI}$ is in solar masses. This relation shows remarkably little scatter over several orders of magnitude ($10^7 - 10^{11} M_o$) in HI mass. "

An extreme example of a galaxy warp is shown in Fig. 4.3. Warps typically begin at $r_{25}$ of the stellar disk exhibit a straight line of nodes between $r_{25}$ and $r_{26.5}$, beyond which the line of nodes precesses in a loosely wound leading spiral pattern (Briggs 1990; Jozsa 2007). Warps are generally thought to originate from an interaction between the disk and the surrounding halo and intergalactic medium (see Sellwood 2013 for a recent review). "

For $N_{HI} > 1 M_o pc^{-2}$, this distribution can be modelled as a Gaussian, with typical full-width half-maximum values of $500-700$ pc (e.g. Peters et al. 2013a). Since the HI disk thickness is a measure of the gravitational potential, low-mass galaxies have thicker HI disks (e.g. Brinks et al. 2002; Banerjee et al. 2011). The vertical extents of HI disks are observed to be constant across the star-forming disks of edge-on galaxies and increase farther out where the disk self-gravity decreases (e.g. Olling 1996a). This flaring of HI disks can be exploited to constrain the shape of dark matter halos (e.g. Olling 1996b; Banerjee et al. 2008; O’Brien et al. 2010b; Allaert et al. 2015; Peters et al. 2016)."

    "Sensitive observations reveal reservoirs of low-column density (below $N_{HI} = 1 M_o pc^{-2}$) gas at high galactic latitudes, that can extend several kpc above and below the HI disk (e.g. Oosterloo et al. 2007). The rotation velocity of the high-latitude gas lags behind that in the disk plane, with the rotation velocity decreasing as the distance from the plane increases (Benjamin 2012). It is possible the material is raining down on the disk as a result of a galactic fountain mechanism, or that it is being accreted from the intergalactic medium. Detailed models of the morphology and kinematics of high-latitude gas suggest that both mechanisms may be at play (e.g. Fraternali &amp; Binney 2008, Rand &amp; Benjamin 2012; Armillotta et al. 2016).

    "Observations of neutral hydrogen in dwarf galaxies throughout the Local Group have revealed that satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are generally HI-deficient (e.g. [<cite data-cite=\"1999AJ....117.1758Y\">Young 1999</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....117.1758Y); [<cite data-cite=\"2000AJ....119..188Y\">Young 2000</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AJ....119..188Y); [<cite data-cite=\"2009ApJ...696..385G\">Grcevich &amp; Putman 2009</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...696..385G)); despite sensitive and extensive searches, no HI emission has been detected in most of the known Milky Way and Andromeda satellites.

While still containing HI gas today, most of the potential Milky Way escapees have lower HI fractions and show signatures of past interactions in their stellar and gaseous components, supporting the idea that processing of galaxies occurs as the result of interactions with the major spiral galaxies in the Local Group."
