    "# Resolved HI properties of galaxies and star formation\n",
    "\n",
    "HI is the raw material for star formation and therefore ultimately drives this process. Understanding the interplay of HI in the ISM is therefore a key consideration. On global scales, there exists a tight correlation between star formation rate (SFR) per unit area and the surface density of cold gas (neutral and molecular hydrogen) over several orders of magnitude -- \"the Schmidt Law\" (Kennicutt 1998a, 1998b). However, global studies of star formation provide little insight into the factors that regulate and drive star formation; spatially resolved studies provide a more fundamental approach to SFR correlations. These studies have recently become feasible thanks to the advent of high spatial resolution HI and CO observations of galaxies combined with multiwavelength SFR tracers. However, challenges do exist when going to small scales and these must be taken into account. SFR tracers and diagnostics are generally calibrated to integrated systems that average over small-scale variations in stellar age, IMF population and gas/dust geometry. Therefore on small linear scales and at low SFRs, scaling laws are expected to break down.\n",

There is, however, a shift between peaks in the cold atomic (HI) and molecular (CO) distributions, which is likley due to HI formed by photodissociation of molecular gas due to hot starts. Similarly, offsets between star formation tracers probe variations in the ISM conditions.\n",

    "The Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS; Kennicutt et al. 2003), is a comprehensive, multiwavelength project designed to study the properties of the dusty ISM. The sample consists of 75 galaxies within 30 Mpc, selected to be \"typical\" of local galaxies\". The full dataset combines Spitzer 3.6-160$\\mu$m imaging and 5-40$\\mu$m resolved spectroscopy of the nucleus and selected extra-nuclear targets, with Chandra X-Ray, Galex UV, optical BVRI, H$\\alpha$ maps, NIR JHK photometry, HST Paschen $\\alpha$ imaging, SCUBA sub-mm, CO, BIMA SONG radio continuum, and VLA HI maps.\n",

    "Local SFR density is virtually uncorrelated with HI density, and the upper limit to the local HI densities corresponds to the column density where the HI efficiently converts to molecular form. This roughly coincides with the turnover seen in the figure, which suggests that the threshold may be driven, at least partly, by an atomic-molecular phase transition .\n",

Whereas SFR is not correlated with HI (in the inner parts of galaxy disks), it correlates with H$_2$ and total gas.

    "\n",
    "Here M83 is used to illustrate the cycle of star formation. Starting with the fuel, the primordial HI combines to form molecular H$_2$, which gravitationally collapses to form new stars. Massive O and B stars radiate copious amounts of UV photons, which are detected by GALEX in the FUV and NUV bands. Most of the radiation, however, is scattered and absorbed by dust grains that are distributed throughout the spiral arms and birth clouds. The radiation excites the complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules that form on dust grains located outside of HII regions. These photodissociation regions are detected by WISE in the W3 12 μm band and by Spitzer in the IRAC 8 μm band. The radiation warms small dust grains to temperatures of ∼100-150 K, radiating (modified blackbody) photons in the mid-infrared window that is detected by WISE with the W4 22 μm band and by Spitzer with the MIPS 24 μm band. Over time the stars disperse from their birth clouds, becoming visible to detection at optical wavelengths. Massive stars burn hot and bright, living for only a few to tens of millions of years before exploding and sending their gas back into the ISM for recycling. Less massive stars live much longer: solar-type stars burn for billions of years, evolving into luminous red giants. These stars, far more numerous that the massive O and B stars, form the aggregate massive backbone of the galaxy. These cool giants emit most of their photospheric radiation in the near-IR window, detected and studied by WISE with the W1 3.4μm and W2 4.6μm bands and by Spitzer with the IRAC 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm bands. \n",

There is a striking spatial correspondence between the neutral gas and the integrated (line of sight) PAH–ISM emission, except for the nuclear region, where the HI has been converted to molecular gas. The atomic hydrogen traces the current star formation on large angular scales. Since it is the molecular hydrogen gas that serves as the primary fuel for star formation, we would not necessarily expect the neutral hydrogen to be so closely correlated with the PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emission arising from PDRs (photodissociation regions) and HII regions. \n",

The largest star formation complexes have both UV and IR light strongly correlated, appearing as white blobs, this occurs notably near the bar ends and the connecting eastern spiral arm. The UV–IR color composite also reveals striking differences between the distribution of young stars and the warm ISM: (1) The GALEX emission is clearly extended beyond the mid-IR limits, highlighting localized star formation that is well outside of the primary (optical R25) disk and spiral arm system, a property that is also seen in many other spiral galaxies studied with GALEX (e.g., Thilker et al. 2005; Goddard et al. 2010). (2) The nuclear region and much of the central bar have very little UV emission, while the mid-IR continuum is bright in all WISE bands. (3) There is diffuse UV emission filling most of the disk, likely arising from B stars that have dispersed from their birth clouds. (4) The trailing edge of the spirals arms have strong W3 IR emission (note the orange/brown color inside of the spiral arms), arising from excited 11.3 μm PAH emission integrated along the galaxy’s line of sight. (5) To the north of the nucleus, near the edge of the mid-IR disk, there is a large mid-IR “void” or fork in the spiral arms; in contrast, the entire area is filled with UV emission arising from massive star clusters.\n",

    "The origin of tidal tails remained a subject of intense debate until advances in computers enabled the numerical experiments of Toomre & Toomre (1972). They showed that brief, but intense, encounters of two disk galaxies were sufficient to produce observed tidal tails. They also showed that a grazing encounter, or close passage, could produce deformation and potentially lead to the creation of bridges and tails. Although tidal features created by first encounters gradually vanish into the intergalactic medium, or are recaptured by the galaxy, they have been shown to remain visible for several 10$^9$ years (Springel & White 1999).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, tidal fields are easier to detect when they act on a regular distribution of matter, rather than isotropic structures. Hence tidal features such as tails and bridges are seen around disk galaxies, where motion is well-organized, compared to ellipticals where more isotropic distributions of positions and velocities result. This would also be true for all structures with a high degree of symmetry (halos, bulges, and so on), compared to axisymmetric structures like disks.\n",

Bottom: same but for an elliptical galaxy. No tidal structures are visible. From Duc & Renaud (2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a flyby, galaxies do not do no loose enough orbital energy to become bound to each other, and thus they escape without merging. Due to gravitational torques, gas will either respond as in inflow or outflow. For a relatively distant interaction, a large fraction of gas can be tidally ejected into the intergalactic medium (see e.g. Kim et al. 2009). Material that is relatively unbound is expected to expand, with more bound structures becoming reaccreted within less than ~ 1 Gyr (Hibbard & Mihos 1995, Hibbard & van Gorkom 1996).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the exchange of orbital angular momentum (through dynamical friction) is high, the mean distance between the progenitors rapidly decreases (as a damped oscillation) before they finally merge. During the first, distant passage, however, galactic material is stripped off. Because these tails are generally long-lived, they can indicate past interactions even when only the merger remnant remains.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Whereas tides and mergers are low velocity encounters, galaxy harassment refers to the effects induced by fast, repetitive \"fly-by\" tidal encounters between galaxies and is common in galaxy groups and clusters. The effect of harassment is morphological disturbance, often accompanied by bursts of star formation, forming asymmetrical galaxies, disturbed galaxies, warps, bars, and tidal tails.

    "## Galaxy Interactions: Ram Pressure and Viscous Stripping\n",
    "\n",
    "Ram pressure stripping appears to be an effective mechanism in dense clusters with a hot, X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. A galaxy moving through the stationary hot gas experiences an exerted ram pressure, like a \"wind\" (Gunn & Gott 1972). This mechanism can \"sweep\" gas, particularly cold, neutral gas, from the galaxy as the ISM of the galaxy interacts with the ICM of the cluster. Turbulent/viscous stripping (Nulsen 1982) is the result of instabilities caused by the relative movement of gas at different temperatures and densities, similar to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Although the relative contribution of this effect in clusters is not clear, it is not expected to dominate. However, in systems such as groups, that lack a substantial hot X-ray halo, but instead contain copious tidal debris in cold, neutral form, turbulent viscous stripping may play a key role in galaxy quenching.\n",

    "Tidal tails are the most common tracer of environmental effects. Unlike bridges, tails have particles escaping to infinity. To form tails, galaxies should ideally be of similar mass. Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) form within tidal tails, particularly at the end of a tidal tail, and have masses greater than 10$^8$ M⊙. They are gravitationally bound, rotating objects that are kinematically decoupled from their parent galaxies. Simulations suggest that their formation in galaxy collisions is not very efficient, and require relatively low impact velocities (< 250 km/s) leading to mergers, prograde encounters and initially extended gas in the parent galaxies. Only TDGs that form close to the ends of tidal tails generally survive more than 1 Gyr. Under these conditions, the production rate is approximately 1 per favourable merger.\n",

    "Slow encounters are less likely in a cluster environment and therefore also the presence of tails and bridges. In loose groups, close encounters are rare, and thefore merging. Tidal tails are an excellent probe of interactions, but because of their low surface brightness their frequency is probably highly underestimated. A census of collisional debris may well help constrain the recent mass assembly of nearby galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be challenging in dense environments to distinguish between the effects of tides and ICM-ISM interactions. Where galaxies are HI deficient and stellar disks are undisturbed, ICM-ISM interactions are likely responsible. Disturbed stellar disks are generally the product of tidal interactions or minor mergers, although ICM-ISM interactions may also contribute. \n",
