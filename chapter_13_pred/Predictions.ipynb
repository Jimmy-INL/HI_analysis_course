 " $$\\sigma_{\\rm{PS}} = \frac{SEFD}{n_c \sqrt{n_{pol}\\,N(N-1)\\,t_{int}\\,\\delta_\\nu} \n",
 " where $SEFD$ (in Jy) is the system equivalent flux density of an individual antenna (defined as the flux density of a radio source that doubles the system temperature), $n_c$ is the correlator efficiency ($n_c \\sim 1$ for modern systems), $n_{pol}$ is the number of polarization products included in the image ($n_{pol}=2$ for the vast majority of HI surveys), $N$ is the number of antennas, $t_{int}$ (in seconds) is the net integration time of the observation, and $\\delta_\\nu$ (in Hz) is the spectral channel width. This equation illustrates that the signal-to-noise of an observation depends linearly on the antenna sensitivity (ie. the SEFD), and on the inverse square root of both the observing time and the spectral channel width. For a given instrument configuration, estimates of $\\sigma_{PS}$ and the assumed spectral channel width $\\delta_\\nu$ are essential for predicting HI survey detections. Clearly, smoothing the data to a lower spectral resolution (larger $\\delta_\\nu$) will increase a survey's sensitivity. "

    "Given the point-source and surface-brightness sensitivities of each pointing, the second important factor governing the HI detections in a survey is the survey volume. The areal coverage of the survey is clearly an important factor in determining this volume. For surveys that will tile the sky to achieve near-uniform sensitivity in the survey footprint (e.g. [WALLABY on ASKAP](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/WALLABY/)), the survey area is a trivial factor to include when computing HI detections. The issue is more complex for surveys with variable sensitivity due to the sparseness of individual pointings (e.g. [MALS on MeerKAT](http://mals.iucaa.in/))). A survey's volume is also determined by its spectral coverage. While the large bandwidths of modern correlators rarely limit survey volume, radio frequency interference can limit a survey's sensitivity at some frequencies at which redshifted HI lines may fall (due to the elimination of corrupted baselines, effectively reducing $N$ in the sensitivity equation;  [<cite data-cite='2013ApJ...770L..29F'>Fernandez et al. 2013</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...770L..29F) Fernandez et al. 2013), or blind it altogether (e.g. [<cite data-cite='2015MNRAS.446.3526C'>Catinella et al. 2015</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.3526C) Catinella et al. 2015).

    "[Chapter 3](https://github.com/gigjozsa/HI_analysis_course/tree/master/chapter_03_gal) defines the HIMF as the number density of HI detections as a function of their HI mass, and it is now well-measured for HI masses in the range $M_{\\rm{HI}} \\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$ in the local universe (e.g. [<cite data-cite='2016MNRAS.457.4393J'> Jones et al. 2016</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.4393J) Jones et al. 2016; our knowledge of the low-mass end of the HIMF is limited by the sensitivity of extant surveys to these faint sources, of which there are many). The number HI detections as a function of HI mass in a given volume slice of an HI survey can therefore be obtained by integrating the HIMF: \n", 
  "$$N_{gal}(M_{\\rm{HI}}) = \\int \\phi(M_{\\rm{HI}}) \\, dV,$$ \n",
    "where $\\phi(M_{\\rm{HI}})$ is the HIMF and $dV$ is a volume element; the equation above may be evaluated analytically from Schechter function fits to the HIMF, although extrapolating galaxy number counts beyond the range spanned by the data (e.g. $M_{\\rm{HI}} \\leq 10^6 M_{\\odot}$) should be treated with caution. As described in [Chapter 1](https://github.com/gigjozsa/HI_analysis_course/tree/master/chapter_01_bas), the HI mass of a source scales with the flux integral of the detected line and distance squared. Given the distance of a volume slice in a survey, the detectability of an HI source predicted to lie in that volume from the HIMF therefore depends on the expected linewidth and the survey sensitivity. Specifically, the expected signal-to-noise $SN_{\\rm{PS}}$ of a (point-source) detection in a given spectral channel can be approximated by: \n",
 " $$SN_{\\rm{PS}} \\sim 235.6 \\, D^2 \\, S_{\\rm{peak}} \\, W \\, \\sigma_{PS}^{-1},$$ \n",
  "where $D$ is the distance to the source in Mpc, $S_{\\rm{peak}}$ is the peak flux of the source in mJy, $W$ is the characteristic width of the source in km/s, and $\\sigma_{PS}$ in mJy is the survey sensitivity for that channel width. The simplest approach for estimating $SN_{PS}$ is to adopt a fixed $W$ for all detections (e.g. [<cite data-cite='2016MNRAS.460.3419M'>Maddox et al. 2016</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.460.3419M) Maddox et al. 2016). For the inclined, rotating disks that are expected to make up the majority of HI sources (see [Chapter 4](https://github.com/gigjozsa/HI_analysis_course/tree/master/chapter_04_egal)), $W$ depends on the rotation speed in the outer disk $V_{rot}$, the disk inclination $i$ along the line-of-sight, and the velocity dispersion $\\sigma_V$ of the disk: \n",

Estimates of $V_{rot}$ for a given $M_{\\rm{HI}}$ can be gleaned from known scaling relations (e.g. the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the gas fraction relation; see [Chapter 3](https://github.com/gigjozsa/HI_analysis_course/tree/master/chapter_03_gal)), by abundance matching the HI velocity function, or  by matching dark matter to HI masses in semi-analytic galaxy formation models (e.g. [<cite data-cite='2012MNRAS.426.3385D'>Duffy et al.

It is then straightforward to compare these sizes to the angular size of the synthesized beam and to match the used cosmological volume to that of the proposed survey and count our resolved galaxies.

These parameters are important as the sensitivity limit is calculated assuming that the HI column completely fills the synthesized beam and is entirely contained within the channel width. The first assumption is generally satisfied as we are interested in resolved galaxies. However, if a galaxy is edge-on ($i=90^{\\circ}$), this might not be true for thinner galaxies at larger distances. Even more so, as HI disks rotate they have a velocity structure and the observed velocities are spread over a velocity range related to the inclination and the maximum rotational velocity, i.e $V_{\\rm{obs}}=V_{\\rm{rot}} \\times \\sin(i)$. This means that for edge-on galaxies in general the emission is spread out over many different channels and the exact distribution could even depend on the shape of the rotation curve. On the other hand we are considering disks. Therefore the column densities observed in an edge-on galaxy are much higher than those in a face-on galaxy as the path through the galaxy is much longer in the radial direction. "

For example, disks with realistic rotation curves and surface brightness distributions that are physically consistent, e.g. more massive galaxies have a higher rotation amplitude, would already be a tremendous improvement on the simple estimates discussed earlier. These disks should then be distributed with random orientations and subsequently the flux received in a given velocity bin should be compared to the column density sensitivity of the survey in order to determine whether this galaxy would be detected. A first attempt at such work can be found in [<cite data-cite='2012MNRAS.426.3385D'>Duffy et al. (2012)</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.3385D) Duffy et al. (2012)."

    "Even though the main issues of whether a galaxy can be detected are discussed in the previous paragraphs, the inclusion of more parameters, such as warps, bars and velocity dispersion, in the phenomenological representation of the disk would increase the accuracy of the predictions. How much so is of course dependent on whether the survey is sensitive to column densities at which these structures manifest themselves."
